        <p>Hobby means a useful work which one does during leisure time for the main purpose of relaxation. Hobby is essential for a change from the regular work. It is that part of the work in which one takes interest and derives pleasure without any motive of profit or monetary benefit. It is true that life is dull without a hobby. The main aim of a hobby is to lighten the boredom of our life and utilise our free time in the best way by keeping ourselves busy and happy. It lies in a man’s instinct and needs to betleveloped.

Every person has a hobby. The most common hobbies are gardening, stamp-collecting and coin collecting while others are pen-friend making, petting of animals, painting, photography, fishing etc. which one adopts according to one’s taste and means of support. These hobbies are indeed very interesting and exciting but not very useful. I enjoy reading and I am fond of my hobby as it is entirely different from those adopted commonly.

On books Francis Bacon has said “Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested.” Books provide a variety in reading and I relish every aspect of this variety in my leisure time. My hobby contributes a lot to increase my knowledge. Ever since my childhood I have developed my reading habit and now it has become an essential part of my life.
